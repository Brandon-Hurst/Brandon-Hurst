## Hello! I'm Brandon. 

I'm Brandon Hurst (he/him). I'm an Electrical Engineer with a deep interest in Embedded Systems. Currently I'm a Software Field Applications Engineer at Analog Devices, working on all manner of digital products and software within the broad ADI portfolio including Industrial Data Converters, Automotive Ethernet, and processors from small-scale MCUs to high-performance DSPs.  

- ðŸ”­ **Recent Project**:      Adding CircuitPython support for MAX32 MCUs! --> https://github.com/Brandon-Hurst/circuitpython/tree/port/max32690. This is done, just getting the PR in order :)
- ðŸŒ± **Currently learning**:   How the heck to work with Linux drivers on BeagleBone Black & Raspberry Pi (following _Mastering Embedded Linux Programming_ by Frank Vasquez & Chris Simmonds)
- ðŸŽ¶ **Hobbies & Interests**:    Far too many to fill my time...music, the outdoors, running, climbing...
